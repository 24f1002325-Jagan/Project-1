# Project-1

* I scraped the data using Python with the requests library to interact with the GitHub API and pandas for data manipulation and storage in CSV format.

* One surprising finding was that many users with over 100 followers had very few public repositories, suggesting a focus on quality over quantity in their contributions.

* I recommend developers actively engage in open-source projects and maintain an up-to-date GitHub profile to enhance their visibility and attract potential job opportunities.
